# ECS289L: Multimodal Deep Learning for Alzheimer’s Disease Progression Prediction

## Overview

This project develops a multimodal deep learning framework for predicting the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using the ADNI dataset. The approach integrates MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarker data to improve classification performance. The project explores preprocessing, feature extraction, embedding generation, and multimodal fusion strategies, focusing on limited-sample scenarios.
